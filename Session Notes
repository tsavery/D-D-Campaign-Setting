Draining Teleporting Dagger

This +2 Dagger has a blade covered in runes that glow faintly red. Once per day, as a swift action, the wielder may utter the command word to teleport 15 feet in any direction. They may leave or enter a threatened area with this teleport without provoking an attack of opportunity. The dagger feeds off life force to perform this ability. If the dagger is not used to deal damage at some point between when it is activated and the end of the wielder's next turn, it will inflict 2d4 points of damage on the wielder in order to replenish itself.
