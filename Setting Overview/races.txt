1. The Gnomes

The gnomish empire of Kasdron is one of the oldest in the world. During it's height, the empire controlled much of the world and subjugated many peoples from other lands. They were able to effectively control such a large span of land because they were the first to make use of widespread magic as gnomes are naturally predisposed to magic. They also used their magic to enslave and subjugate other races.

Over time, the Kasdroni gnomes became spread to thin, and easier access to magic over time allowed for greater resistance against them. This eventually lead to a total collapse of the empire, with it officially ending with the death of Hisdri III in battle, the last king of the gnomes.

After the collapse of the empire, the other races began to take back land from the gnomes, though many old buildings in formerly gnomish cities still retain their distinct architecture. The gnomes themselves are somewhat rare to find, spread all over the world with no place to call their home any longer. Though the empire collapsed 200 years ago, gnomes are still mistrusted because of their morally questionable past as a race.
